- Create a **new branch** when adding new features
- **Commit and Push** with appropriate messages/comments
- **Always pull BEFORE pushing to avoid merge conflicts**
- Do not edit shared scenes without making sure no one else is also editing, as this can cause merge conflicts (you can use a test scene if need be)
